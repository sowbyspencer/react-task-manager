# Overview

My focus is centered around upgrading my skills and understanding of contemporary programming techniques. I am recreating a Task Management System using React. This is a transition from a previous [TypeScript project](https://github.com/sowbyspencer/Web-Based-Task-Management-System). This offers me a valuable opportunity to delve into the intricacies of React.js.

In the current state, the project successfully mirrors the appearance of my previous TypeScript project through React components. However, the search functionality, `Task.js`, and `TaskList.js` components have not been implemented. Lines of code that were going towards the handling of the states has been commented out and replaced with lines of code to maintain compilability and appearance.

# Web Pages

The application's interface is currently simplified, focusing on the main page that lists tasks. Functionality to add, remove, edit, and search hasn't been implemented, only the HTML for appearance has.

# Development Environment

Developed using Visual Studio Code, the project leverages React.js for building user interfaces. Node.js and npm are used for dependency management and to run the development server. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), simplifying the setup process for React applications.

# Future Work

Looking ahead, the project aims to:

- Consider a fresh approach to more effectively utilize React's component-based architecture, rather than closely mirroring the TypeScript project structure.
- Implement the search functionality, `Task.js`, and `TaskList.js` components to enhance task management capabilities.
- Explore backend integration for persistent data storage.
- Further improve UI/UX for a seamless user experience.
